                A guy I know came to me one day saying he is starting a company and would like someone to
                do a website for him. He gave me a few colours and folder with stock images and told me 
                I had 100% creative control. This is my first attempt at a real website and 
                although it was never truely finished, I'm happy with how the look turned out.
