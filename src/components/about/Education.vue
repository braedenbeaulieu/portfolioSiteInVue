            From three years of college to hundreds of sleepless nights, 
            my knowledge of Web Development starts and ends with sitting down in front of my laptop for hours and hours
            making new things and having fun the whole way. Everything I know comes from several hard working teachers, YouTube, 
            and a little thing called 'Google'.
